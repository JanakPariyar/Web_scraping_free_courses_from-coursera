# Web_scraping_free_courses_from-coursera
This project is done while i was creating dataset for free courses online and thought to share with guthub community.
# Methodlogy
Used BeautifulSoup to do the scraping .
# findings
Coursera has different type of courses available like projects,learn,specialization,professional-certificates and so on .
the free courses are labeled (not the good word) as projects which are generally free . They often redirects to learn,which are paid so i used 
allow_redirects=False which does not take in account of the redirected pages.
Happy Coding :)
